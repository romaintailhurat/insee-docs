# Goal of the sprint

Build web clients backed by CSPA services or CSPA-related services.

These backends expose web API that the clients consume. So we aim at developing lightweight JavaScript clients using modern tooling.

# Tools of the trade

## Support techs

### Node.js

It's the backbone of the developer tools.

[Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### npm

Stands for Node Package Manager, a vital utility.

npm is included with Node Installation.

### Webpack

Webpack primary use is for the bundling of the applications for deploy / delivery.

It also provides numerous facilities for smoothing the developer experience.

Installation via npm.

### Babel

Translates ES2015 code to a lower JavaScript specification, which permits the use of modern version of JavaScript but also support for a large span of environnements (i.e. web browsers).

Installation via npm.

### Editor

[Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) are the running contenders for the best JS editor.

### Git

The [most valuable version control tool](https://git-scm.com/). Could be used in combination with Github / Gitlab.

## Building blocks

A list of the main libraries to be used ; all could be installed via npm.

### React

Web components done right =)

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) enables the creation of UI components using JavaScript functions or classes.

### Redux

[Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/) is an implementation of the Flux patterns, which provides an architectural framework for managing app state in a scalable fashion.

## Tests

### Mocha

[One](https://mochajs.org/) of the most used JS test framework.

### Enzyme

Provided by Airbnb, [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) provides features for testing React components.
